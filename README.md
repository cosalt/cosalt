I'm a BSc (Hons) Computing Science student at the University of East Anglia with a strong focus on software engineering, quantitative finance, and algorithmic trading. Beyond my coursework and since Year 10, I'm always exploring new concepts and building projects to sharpen my skills and apply programming to real-world financial and technical challenges.

### ðŸ”­ My Projects

* **[Quantitative Trading Tool](https://github.com/cosalt/Quantitative-Trading-Tool)**: A GUI built in Streamlit to calculate call and put values from user input. It applies the Black-Scholes model using NumPy and implements a client-server architecture for scalability.
* **[Scheduling Algorithms](https://github.com/cosalt/scheduling-algorithms)**: An implementation of the Round-Robin scheduling algorithm to simulate CPU process management.
* **[Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Calculator](https://github.com/cosalt/Reverse-Polish-Notation-Calculator)**: A stack-based calculator designed to parse and evaluate mathematical expressions written in RPN.
* **[Lexical Analyzer](https://github.com/cosalt/lexical-analyzer)**: A simple lexical analyzer to scan source code and convert it into a sequence of tokens.
* **[Recursive Caesar Cipher Algorithm](https://github.com/cosalt/Recursive-Caesar-Cipher-Algorithm)**: A recursive implementation of the classic Caesar cipher, focusing on an elegant and efficient approach to encryption.
* **[Motor:Bit Obstacle Avoidance Robot](https://github.com/cosalt/RoboticsMotorBit)**: Code for a robot designed to navigate its environment, which helped my team earn 2nd place in the Bangkok Robotics Competition.
