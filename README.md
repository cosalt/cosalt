I'm a BSc (Hons) Computing Science student at the University of East Anglia with a strong focus, interest and passion on software engineering, quantitative finance, and algorithmic trading. Beyond my coursework and since Year 10, I'm always exploring new concepts and building projects to sharpen my skills and apply programming to real-world financial and technical challenges.

### 🔭 My Projects

* **[Quantitative Trading Tool](https://github.com/cosalt/Quantitative-Trading-Tool)**: A GUI built in Streamlit to calculate call and put values from user input. It applies the Black-Scholes model using NumPy and implements a client-server architecture for scalability.
* **[Quantitative Finance Algorithms & Models](https://github.com/cosalt/Quant-Algorithms)**: This project serves as my personal journey into the world of financial models, algorithms, and quantitative analysis.
* **[Scheduling Algorithms](https://github.com/cosalt/scheduling-algorithms)**: An implementation of the Round-Robin scheduling algorithm to simulate CPU process management.
* **[Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Calculator](https://github.com/cosalt/Reverse-Polish-Notation-Calculator)**: A stack-based calculator designed to parse and evaluate mathematical expressions written in RPN.
* **[Lexical Analyzer](https://github.com/cosalt/lexical-analyzer)**: A compiler front-end tool that performs lexical analysis by scanning source code, breaking it into tokens, and classifying them by type.
* **[Recursive Caesar Cipher Algorithm](https://github.com/cosalt/Recursive-Caesar-Cipher-Algorithm)**: A recursive implementation of the classic Caesar cipher, focusing on an elegant and efficient approach to encryption.
* **[Motor:Bit Obstacle Avoidance Robot](https://github.com/cosalt/RoboticsMotorBit)**: Code for a robot designed to navigate its environment, which helped my team earn 2nd place in the Bangkok Robotics Competition.

### 🚀 Interests & Activities

When I'm not coding, I'm actively involved in my university community. I'm a member of the **Finance and Investment Society** and the **Oakwood Fund**, where I explore financial markets and investment strategies. I also enjoy cycling, going to the gym and gardening(i've got a 200 cacti🌵 collection and a 5 and growing bonsai collection. i also like to experiment in cross-breeding peppers🌶️)
